  ### Here we define the root location...

  ### request that comes in to /, it should first try to serve the URI exactly
  ### as it is, and if it doesn't find anything by that name to then try and
  ### serve the URI as a directory, and if it doesn't find a directory by that
  ### name to then spit out a 404 error and give up.
      try_files $uri $uri/ =404;

  ### This location definition prevents Nginx from serving any files which begin
  ### with a dot, and further to not log any access attempts or 404s for files
  ### which begin with dots, to keep your access and error logs clean.

  ### This location definition prevents Nginx from serving any files which begin
